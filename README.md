## About

I build **interactive web applications**, **educational tools**, and **games**, with a strong focus on clean UI/UX and practical problem-solving.

My work sits at the intersection of frontend engineering and creative development — from production-ready React apps to Unity-based games and learning tools.

**Currently:**
- Developing [Audio Dojo](https://github.com/ygolan93/audio-dojo) — a React + Firebase app for critical listening and audio training  
- Rebuilding *Beavermania* — a Unity 3D game targeting WebGL  
- Teaching assistant for Unity at the Open University’s *Hasifa* School  

Outside of code: suggests systems, mentor, guitarist, and continuous learner.
